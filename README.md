# Creating a Cool-finding app for twitter
# Experiment to discover clusters of 'similar' and 'disimilar' groups among those you follow. Aiming to:
# - quantify how much overlap among friends of friends of friends...to 'measure' how much of a 'bubble' one's twitter feed is...
# - reveal cool people/ideas to follow, including ones that would never come across my radar because they belong to networks that are the furthest away from me! (or the user of the app).
