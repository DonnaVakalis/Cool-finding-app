# Creating a Cool-finding app for twitter
# Experiment for learning to analyze relationships using twitter friends network - ultimately to then discover clusters of 'similar' and 'disimilar' groups. Aiming to reveal cool people/ideas to follow, including ones that would never come across my radar because they belong to networks that are the furthest away from me! (or the user of the app).
